# MapPagerView

A MapView combined with a ViewPager for ultimate search efficiency! Can be used in an Activity or Fragment

## Features
MapPagerView encapsulates a MapView, ViewPager, and map clustering so that you can present an uncluttered, easily searchable interface to your users

## How to use
1. Add MapPagerView into your layout xml:

  ```
  <com.cdk.bettermapsearch.MapPagerView
        android:id="@+id/map_pager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```
  ```
  MapPagerView mapPagerView = findViewById(R.id.map_pager);
  mapPagerView.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
  mapPagerView.getMapAsync(this);
  ```
2. MapPagerView serves as a delegate for MapViews lifecycle methods, so you'll need to make sure to add all of the usual lifecycle methods that you use for MapView.
3. When the GoogleMap is ready, you'll receive a callback from MapPagerView (supplied to the `getMapAsync` method) that provides all of the fields needed to create your custom MarkerRenderer, which you give back to MapPagerView.
4. Use the `updateItems()` method to populate data on the map.

## Customizability
* The abstract class `CustomMarkerRenderer` controls the logic of when to show items & clusters as selected, you'll just need to implement the 4 abstract methods that handle the UI of the markers
* The abstract class `MapPagerAdapter` controls the ViewPager logic, it requires 2 types: your data model class and the ViewHolder type
* Obviously you'll also need to create your own ViewHolder
* MapPager view has a method `setClusteringEnabled(boolean)` that allows you to turn marker clustering on and off
